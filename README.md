# rtMedia Test Data #

This repo contains all the test data to test rtMedia Plugins and Add-ons. We mainly use this in our [Automation Script](https://github.com/rtCamp/rtMedia/blob/develop/bin/.travis.yml#L56) while creating test site 

## Why? ##
Maintaining the seperate repo for test data to keep other repo size minimal.
